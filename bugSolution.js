```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    './node_modules/@myorg/my-component/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}' // add any external components
  ], // <-- Corrected content option including all relevant file extensions and directories
  theme: {
    // ... your theme configurations ...
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
To fix this, ensure that the paths within the `content` array accurately point to all directories containing your HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, or TSX files (or any other file types containing Tailwind classes). Add any missing extensions like `.ts` or `.tsx`, and verify that the base directory is correct. Also check that any external component libraries are accounted for in the content array.
